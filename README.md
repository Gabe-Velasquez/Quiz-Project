# Quiz-Project
## Introduction
Created a fun interactive quiz for people to test their knowledge against one another. Think you have what it takes? Give the test a try! I really liked this project because I needed to think about the project a little bit differently compared to last projects. On how functions will run based on events that happen on the page.

## Credits

Used https://rgbacolorpicker.com/ to determine which color to use on the guess indicator. 
Resources that I used especially when saving to local storage and how to load from local storage was from James Q Quick (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfOv18lCMmw). 
I referenced our past zoom meetings to see how to reference to html elements in our scripts. Used mdn and w3schools on display properties when events were ran.
